\chorus{}\Am{}How long, how \F{}long will I \C{}slide,\\

\verse{1}\Am{}I heard your voice through a \Em{}photograph,\\
\Am{}I thought it up it brought \Em{}up the past,\\
\Am{}once you know you can \Em{}never go back,\\
I’ve got to \G{}take it on the \Am{}otherside.

\verse{2}Centuries are what it meant to me,\\
a cemetery where I marry the sea,\\
stranger things could never change my mind,\\
I’ve got to take it on the otherside,\\
\G{}take it on the \Am{}otherside,\\
\G{}take it on, \Am{}take it on.\\

\verse{3}Pour my life into a paper cup,\\
the ashtray’s full and I’m spilling my guts,\\
she wants to know am I still a slut,\\
I’ve got to take it on the otherside.

\verse{4}Scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed,\\
a candidate for my soul mate bled,\\
push the trigger and pull the thread,\\
I’ve got to take it on the otherside,\\
take it on the otherside,\\
take it on, take it on.\\
