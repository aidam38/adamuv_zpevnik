\verse{1}Through \Dm[7]{}early morning \G[7]{}fog I see\\
\C[maj]{}visions of the \Am[7]{}things to be,\\
the \Dm[7]{}pains that are with\G[7]{}held for me,\\
I \C{}realize and \Am[7]{}I can see\A[7]{}.

\chorus{}That \Dm[7]{}suicide is \G[7]{}painless,\\
it \C[maj]{}brings on many \Am[7]{}changes\\
and \F[maj]{}I can \Am{}take or \Dm[7]{}leave it \G[7]{}if I \Am{}please.

but as it works it's way on in,\\
the pain grow stronger watch it grin.\\
For\ldots{}+ \textbf{R:}

\verse{6}A brave man once requested me\\
to answer questions that are key,\\
is it to be or not to be\\
and I replied \uv{Oh, why ask me.}\\
'Cause\ldots{}+ \textbf{R:}

And you can do the same thing if you please.\\
