\song{Behind Blue Eyes}{The Who (verze od Limp Bizkit)}{40pt}{0.95}{
\verse{1}{}\Em{}No one knows what it's \G{}like to be the \D[sus2]{}bad man,\\
to be the \C[add9]{}sad man, be\A[sus2]{}hind blue eyes.\\
And no one knows what it's like to be hated,\\
to be fated to telling only lies.

\chorus{}But my \C{}dre\D{}ams, they aren't as \G{}empty,\\
as my \C{}conscience\D{} seems to \E{}be.\\
I have \Hm{}hours, only \C{}lonely,\\
my love is \D{}vengeance that's never \A[sus2]{}free. 

\verse{2}{}No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings,\\
like I do, and I blame you.\\
No one bites back as hard on their anger,\\
none of my pain and woe can show through.\\
\textbf{R:} 

\verse{3}{}No one knows what it's like to be mistreated,\\ 
to be defeated, behind blue eyes.\\
No one know how to say that they're sorry\\
and don't worry, I'm not telling lies.\\
\textbf{R:} 

\verse{4}{}No one knows what its like to be the bad man,\\
to be the sad man, behind blue eyes.\\
