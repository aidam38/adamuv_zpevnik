that they're \D[sus4]{}gonna throw it back to \A[sus4]{}you.\\

\verse{2} Backbeat, the word is on the street\\ 
that the fire in your heart is out.\\
I'm sure you've heard it all before,\\
but you never really had a doubt.\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
feels the way I do about you now.

\verse{*}And \C[add9]{}all the roads we \D{}have to walk are \Em{}winding\\
and \C[add9]{}all the lights that \D{}lead us there are \Em{}blinding.\\
\C[add9]{}There are many \D{}things that I would \G{}like to \G[/F$\sharp$]{}say to \Em{}you,\\
but I don't know \A[7sus4]{}how.

\verse{3}Today was gonna be the day,\\
but they'll never throw it back to you.\\
By now, you should've somehow\\
realized what you're not to do.\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
feels the way I do about you now.

\verse{*}And all the roads that lead you there were winding\\
and all the lights that light the way are blinding.\\
There are many things that I would like to say to you,\\
but I don't know how.

\textbf{R: $(2\times)$}~\\
I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me.\\
You're gonna be the one that saves me.\\
You're gonna be the one that saves me.\\
