\verse{1}\Am{}Turn around, every now and then I get a \G{}little bit\\
lonely and you're never coming round.\\
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit\\
tired of listening to the sound of my tears.

\vskip -2ex
\C{}Turn around, every now and then I get a \Bb{}little bit\\
nervous that the best of all the years have gone by.\\
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit\\ 
terrified and then I see the look in your eyes.

\verse{2}Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit\\
restless and I dream of something wild.\\
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit\\ 
helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms.

Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit\\ 
angry and I know I've got to get out and cry.\\
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit\\ 
terrified but then I see the look in your eyes.

Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.\\
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall a\G{}part.

\scalebox{.95}[1.0]{\chorus{}And I \Em{}need you now \C{}tonight, and I \D{}need you more than \G{}ever}\\
\scalebox{.95}[1.0]{And if you'll only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever.}\\
\scalebox{.95}[1.0]{And we'll only be making it right, cause we'll \D{}never be wrong} 

To\Em{}gether we can take it to the \D{}end of the line,\\
your \Em{}love is like a shadow on me \A{}all of the time.\\
I \G{}don't know what to do and I'm \D{}always in the dark,\\
we're \Em{}living in a powder keg and \A{}giving off sparks.

I really need you to\G{}night, for\D{}ever's gonna \Hm{}start to\C{}night,\\
for\D{}ever's gonna start tonight.

\verse{*}\G{}Once upon a time I was \Em[7]{}falling in love,\\
but \Hm{}now I'm only falling a\C{}part,\\
there's \Am{}nothing I can do, a \D{}total eclipse of the \G{}heart.

Once upon a time there was light in my life,\\
but now there's only love in the dark,\\
nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart
