\song{Sweet Home Alabama}{Lynyrd Skynyrd}{25pt}{0.93}{
\verse{1}\D{}Big \C{}wheels keep on \G{}turning,\G{}\\
carry me home to see my kin.\\
Singing songs about the Southland,\\
I miss Alabamy once again and I think it's a sin.

\verse{2}Well I heard mister Young sing about her,\\
well, I heard old Neil put her down.\\
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember,\\
a Southern man don't need him around anyhow.

\chorus{}Sweet home Alabama,\\
where the skies are so blue.\\
Sweet Home Alabama,\\
\D{}Lord, I'm \C{}coming home to \G{}you. \F{} \hskip 1em \C{}

\verse{3}In Birmingham they love the governor, \F{}boo \C{}hoo \D{}hoo!\\
Now we all did what we could do,\\
now Watergate does not bother me,\\
does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth.\\
\textbf{R:}

\verse{4}Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers\\
and they've been known to pick a song or two,\\
Lord, they get me off so much,\\
they pick me up when I'm feeling blue,\\
now how about you?\\
