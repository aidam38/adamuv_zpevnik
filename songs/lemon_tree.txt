\song{Lemon Tree}{Fool's Garden}{30pt}{1}{
\verse{1}{}I'm \Dm{}sittin' here in the \Am{}boring room,\\
it's just another rainy Sunday afternoon,\\
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do,\\
I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you\\
but \Gm{}nothing ever happens\Am{} -- and I \Dm{}wonder.

\verse{2}{}I'm drivin' around in my car,\\
I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far,\\
I'd like to change my point of view,\\
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you\\
but nothing ever happens -- and I wonder.

\chorus{}I \F{}wonder how, \C{}wonder why\\
\Dm{}yesterday you told me 'bout the \Am{}blue blue sky\\
and \Bb{}all that I can \C{}see\\
is just a yellow \F{}lemon tree\C{}.\\
I'm \F{}turnin' my head \C{}up and down,\\
i'm \Dm{}turnin' turnin' turnin' turnin' \Am{}turnin' around\\
and \Bb{}all that I can \H[dim]{}see\\
is just a yellow \C{}lemon tree\C[7]{}.

Ta, da da didap\ldots{}

\verse{3}{}I'm sittin' here, I miss the power,\\
I'd like to go out, takin' a shower\\
but there's a heavy cloud inside my head,\\
I feel so tired, put myself into bed\\
Where nothing ever happens -- and I wonder.

\verse{*}{}\A{}Isolation \Dm{}is not good for me,\\
\C{}isolation -- \F{}I don't want to \A{}sit on a lemon tree.

\verse{4}{}I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy,\\
baby, anyhow I get another toy\\
and everything will happen -- and you'll wonder.\\
