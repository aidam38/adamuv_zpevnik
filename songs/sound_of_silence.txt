\song{Sound of Silence}{Simon \& Garfunkel}{45pt}{1}{
\capo{6}
\verse{1}\Am{}Hello darkness, my old \G{}friend,\\
I've come to talk with you \Am{}again,\\
because a vision softl\F{}y cree\C{}ping\\
left its seeds while I w\F{}as slee\C{}ping\\
and the \F{}vision that was planted in my \C{}brain\\
still re\C{}mains\Am{}\\
\C{}within the \G{}sound of \Am{}silence.

\verse{2}In restless dreams I walked alone,\\
narrow streets of cobblestone.\\
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,\\
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,\\
when my eyes were stabbed by\\
the flash of a neon light,\\
that split the night\\
and touched the sound of silence.

\verse{3}And in the naked light I saw\\
ten thousand people, maybe more.\\
People talking without speaking,\\
people hearing without listening,\\
people writing songs that voices never share\\
and no one dared\\
disturb the sound of silence.

\verse{4}\uv{Fools,} said I, \uv{You do not know,\\
silence like a cancer grows.\\
Hear my words that I might teach you,\\
take my arms that I might reach you.}\\
But my words like silent raindrops fell\\
and echoed in the wells of silence

\verse{5}And the people bowed and prayed\\
to the neon god they made.\\
And the sign flashed out its warning\\
in the words that it was forming.\\
And the sign said: `The words of the prophets\\
are written on the subway walls\\
and tenement halls\\
and whispered in the sound of silence.'\\
