\verse{1}{}\G{}Mama, \D{}take this badge of \Am{}me,\\
\G{}I can't \D{}use it any\C{}more.\\
It's getting dark, too dark to see,\\
feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

\chorus{}Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door\\
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door\\
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door\\
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door\\

\verse{2}{}Mama, put my guns in the ground,\\
I can't shoot them anymore.\\
That cold black cloud is comin' down,\\
feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.\\
