\song{Falling Slowly}{Glen Hansard \& Markéta Irglová}{20pt}{1}{
\verse{1}
\C{}I don't know you, \F{}but I want you\\
\C{}all the more for \F{}that.\\
Words fall through me and always fool me\\
and I can't react.

\verse{*}\Am{}Games that \G{}never a\F{}mount
to \G{}more than they \Am{}meant,\\
will \G{}play themselves \F{}out.

\chorus{}\C{}Take this sinking \F{}boat and point it \Am{}home,\\
we've still got \F{}time.\\
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice,\\
you've made it now.

\verse{2}Falling slowly, eyes that know me\\
and I can't go back,\\
Moods that take me and erase me\\
and I'll paint it black.

\verse{*}You have suffered enough and warred with yourself,\\
it's time that you won.\\
\textbf{R:}\\
Falling slowly, sing your melody,\\
I'll sing along.\\
