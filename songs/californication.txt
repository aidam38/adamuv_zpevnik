\verse{1}\Am{}Psychic spies from China\\
try to \F{}steal your mind's elation,\\
little girls from Sweden\\
dream of silver screen quotations,\\
and \C{}if you want this \G{}kind of dreams\\
it's \F{}Californi\Dm{}cation.

\vskip -1ex
\verse{2}It's the edge of the world\\
and all of western civilization,\\
the sun may rise in the East\\
at least it settles in the final location.\\
It's understood that Hollywood\\
sells Californication.

\vskip -1ex
\verse{*}\Am{}Pay your surgeon very well\\
to \F{}break the spell of aging,\\
celebrity skin is this your chin\\
or is that war you're waging?

\vskip -1ex
\chorus{}\Am{}First born uni\F{}corn,\\
hard core soft porn.\\
\C{}Dream of Cali\G{}forni\Dm{}cation.\Am{}\\
\C{}Dream of Cali\G{}forni\Dm{}cation.

\verse{3}Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world,\\
be my very own constellation.\\
A teenage bride with a baby inside\\
getting high on information.\\
And buy me a star on the boulevard,\\
it's Californication.

\vskip -1ex
\verse{4}Space may be the final frontier\\
but it's made in a Hollywood basement.\\
Cobain, can you hear the spheres\\
singing songs off station to station.\\
And Alderaan's not far away,\\
it's Californication.

\vskip -1ex
\verse{*}Born and raised by those who praise\\
control of population,\\
everybody's been there\\
and I don't mean on vacation.\\
\textbf{R:}

\vskip -1ex
\verse{5}Destruction leads to a very rough road\\
but it also breeds creation,\\
and earthquakes are to a girl's guitar,\\
they're just another good vibration.\\
And tidal waves couldn't save the world\\
from Californication.

\vskip -1ex
\verse{*}Pay your surgeon very well\\
to break the spell of aging,\\
sicker than the rest, there is no test,\\
but this is what you're craving.\\
