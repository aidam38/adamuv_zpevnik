\verse{1}Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean,\\
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen.\\
I guess if you say so\\
I'd have to pack my things and go.\\
\textbf{R:}

\verse{2}Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way\\
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day.\\
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood\\
you ain't got no money you just ain't no good.\\
Well, I guess if you say so\\
I'd have to pack my things and go.\\
\textbf{R:}\\
\revrpt{} \ldots{}don't you come back no more. \rpt{}\\
