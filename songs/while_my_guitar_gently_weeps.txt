\medskip 

\verse{1}I \Am{}look at you \Am[/G]{}all, see the \D[9/F$\sharp$]{}love there that's \F{}sleeping,\\
\Am{}while my gui\G{}tar gently \D{}weeps.\E[7]{}\\
I \Am{}look at the \Am[/G]{}floor and I \D[9/F$\sharp$]{}see it needs \F{}sweeping,\\
\Am{}still my gui\G{}tar gently \C{}weeps.\E[7]{}

\chorus{}\A{}I don't know \Csm{}why \hskip 0.8em \Fsm{} nobody \Csm{}told you\\
\Hm{}how to unfold your \E{}love.\\
I don't know how someone controlled you,\\
they bought and sold you.

\verse{2}I look at the world and I notice it's turning,\\
while my guitar gently weeps.\\
With every mistake we must surely be learning,\\
still my guitar gently weeps.

\chorus{}I don't know how you were diverted,\\
you were perverted too.\\
I don't know how you were inverted,\\
no one alerted you.

\verse{3}I look from the wings at the play you are staging,\\
while my guitar gently weeps.\\
As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing,\\
still, my guitar gently weeps.

\verse{4} I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping,\\
while my guitar gently weeps.\\
Look at you all\ldots{}\\
still my guitar gently weeps.\\
