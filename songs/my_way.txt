\song{My Way}{Frank Sinatra}{30pt}{1}{
\capo{3}
\verse{1}And \G{}now, the end is \Hm[7/F$\sharp$]{}here,\\
and so I \Dm[6/F]{}face the final \E[7]{}curtain.\\
My \Am{}friend, I'll say it \Am[7/G]{}clear,\\
I'll state my \D[7/F$\sharp$]{}case of which I'm \G{}certain.\\
I've \G{}lived a life that's \G[7]{}full,\\
I traveled \C{}each and every \Cm{}highway\\
and \G{}more, much more than \D[7]{}this, I did it \Am[/G]{}my \hskip 2em \G{}way.

\verse{2}Regrets -- I've had a few,\\
but then again, too few to mention.\\
I did what I had to do\\
and saw it through without exemption.\\
I planned each charted course,\\
each careful step along the byway\\
and more, much more than this, I did it my way.

\chorus{}Yes, there were \G{}times, I'm sure you \G[7]{}knew,\\
when I bit \C{}off more than I could chew,\\
but through it \Am{}all, when there was \D[7]{}doubt,\\
I ate it \Hm{}up and spit it \Em{}out,\\
I faced it \Am{}all and I stood \D[7]{}tall and did it \Am[/G]{}my \hskip 2em \G{}way.

\verse{3}I've loved, I've laughed and cried,\\
I've had my fill, my share of losing.\\
And now, as tears subside,\\
I find it all so amusing.\\
To think I did all that\\
and may I say, not in a shy way,\\
\uv{Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way}

\chorus{}For what is a man, what has he got?\\
If not himself, then he has naught,\\
To say the things he truly feels\\
and not the words of one who kneels.\\
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!
