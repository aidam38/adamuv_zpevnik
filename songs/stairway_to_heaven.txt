%\vskip 8pt
%\verse{1}There's a lady who's sure, all that glitters is gold\\
%and she's buying a stairway to heaven.\\
%\textls[-17]{When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed}\\
% with a word she can get what she came for.\\
% Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
%
%\verse{2}There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure,\\
% 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.\\
% In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,\\
% sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
%
% Ooh, it makes me wonder,\\
%ooh, it makes me wonder.
%
%\verse{3}There's a feeling I get when I look to the west\\
%and my spirit is crying for leaving.\\
%\textls[-25]{In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees}\\
%and the voices of those who stand looking.
%
% Ooh, it makes me wonder,\\
% ooh, it really makes me wonder.
%
%\verse{4}And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,\\
% then the piper will lead us to reason.\\
% And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,\\
%and the forests will echo with laughter.

%\verse{5}\textls[-15]{If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,}\\
% it's just a spring clean for the May queen.\\
%\textls[-15]{Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run}\\
% there's still time to change the road you're on.\\
% And it makes me wonder.
%
%\verse{6}\textls[-45]{Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,}\\
% the piper's calling you to join him.\\
%\textls[-15]{Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know}\\
%your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
%
%\verse{7} And as we wind on down the road,\\
% our shadows taller than our soul.\\
%There walks a lady we all know,\\
%who shines white light and wants to show,\\
%how everything still turns to gold\\
%and if you listen very hard,\\
%the tune will come to you at last,\\
%when we all are one and one is all,\\
%to be a rock and not to roll.
%
% And she's buying the stairway to heaven.\\
