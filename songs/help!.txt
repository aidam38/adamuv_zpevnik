\verse{*}{}\Hm{}Help! I need somebody, \G{}help! Not just anybody,\\
\E{}help! You know I need someone, \A[7]{}help!

\verse{1}{}\A{}When I was younger, so much \Csm{}younger than today,\\
\Fsm{}I never needed anybody's \D{}help in \G{}any \A{}way.\\
But now these days are gone I'm \Csm{}not so self assured,\\
\textls[-25]{\Fsm{}now I find I've changed my mind I've \D{}opened \G{}up the \A{}door.}

\chorus{}\Hm{}Help me if you can I'm feeling down\\
and I \G{}do appreciate you being 'round,\\
\E{}help me get my feet back on the ground,\\
won't you \A{}please, please help me?

\verse{2}{}And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,\\
my independence seems to vanish in the haze.\\
But every now and then I feel so insecure,\\
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.\\
