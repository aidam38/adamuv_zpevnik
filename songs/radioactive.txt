\verse{1}\Am{}I'm waking u\C{}p to ash and du\G{}st\\
I wipe my \D{}brow and I sweat my \Am{}rust\\
I'm breathing in the chemicals\\
I'm breaking in, shaping up,\\
then checking out on the prison bus\\
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

\chorus{}I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones\\
Enough to make my systems blow\\
Welcome to the new age, to the new age\\
Welcome to the new age, to the new age\\
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive\\
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

\verse{2}I raise my flags, don my clothes\\
It's a revolution, I suppose\\
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa\\
I'm breaking in, shaping up,\\
then checking out on the prison bus\\
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa\\

\verse{*}All systems go, sun hasn't died\\
Deep in my bones, straight from inside\\
