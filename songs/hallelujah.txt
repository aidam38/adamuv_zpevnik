\song{Hallelujah}{Leonard Cohen / Jeff Buckley}{30pt}{0.89}{
\verse{1}{}I've \G{}heard there was a \Em{}secret chord,\\
that \G{}David played, and it \Em{}pleased the Lord,\\
but \C{}you don't really \D{}care for music, \G{}do you? \D{}\\
It \G[/H]{}goes like this, the \C{}fourth, the \D{}fifth,\\
the \Em{}minor fall, the \C{}major lift,\\
the \D{}baffled king \H[7]{}composing Halle\Em{}lujah!

\chorus{}Halle\C{}lujah, Halle\Em{}lujah, Halle\C{}lujah, Halle\G{}lu-uu\D{}uu-u\G{}jah! 

\verse{2}{}Your faith was strong, but you needed proof,\\
you saw her bathing on the roof,\\
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.\\
She tied you to a kitchen chair,\\
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair,\\
and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah!\\
\textbf{R:}

\verse{3}{}Baby, I've been here before,\\
I know this room, I've walked this floor,\\
I used to live alone before I knew you.\\
I've seen your flag on the marble arch,\\
but love is not a victory march,\\
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!\\
\textbf{R:}

\verse{4}{}There was a time you let me know,\\
what's really going on below,\\
but now you never show it to me, do you?\\
But I remember, when I moved in you,\\
and the holy dove was moving too,\\
and every breath we drew was Hallelujah!\\
\textbf{R:}

\verse{5}{}Maybe there's a God above,\\
but all I've ever learned from love\\
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.\\
But it's not a cry that you hear at night,\\
it's not somebody who's seen the light,\\
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!\\
\textbf{R:}
