\song{Leaving on a Jet Plane}{John Denver}{50pt}{1}{
\verse{1}All my \C{}bags are packed, I'm \F{}ready to go,\\
I'm \C{}standing here out\F{}side your door,\\
I \C{}hate to wake you \F{}up to say good\G{}bye. 

\verse{2}But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,\\
the taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn,\\
already, I'm so lonesome I could die. 

\chorus{}So kiss me and smile for me,\\
tell me that you'll wait for me,\\
hold me like you'll never let me go. 

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,\\
don't know when I'll be back again,\\
oh, babe, I hate to go. 

\verse{3}{}There's so many times I've let you down,\\
so many times I've played around,\\
I tell you now they don't mean a thing. 

\verse{4}Every place I'll go I think of you,\\
every song I sing I'll sing for you,\\
when I come back,  I'll bring your wedding ring.\\
\textbf{R:} 
\clearpage
\verse{5}{}Now the time has come to leave you,\\
one more time let me kiss you,\\
then close your eyes, I'll be on my way. 

\verse{6} Dream about the days to come,\\
when I won't have to leave alone,\\
about the times, I won't have to say.\\
\textbf{R: + $\downarrow$}

I'm leaving on a jet plane,\\
don't know when I'll be back again,\\
oh, babe, I hate to go.\\
