\verse{1}So close, no matter how far,\\
couldn't be much more from the heart,\\
forever trustin' who we are\\
and nothing else matters.

\verse{2}Never opened myself this way,\\
life is ours, we live it our way,\\
all these words I don't just say\\
and nothing else matters.

\verse{3}Trust I seek and I find in you,\\
everyday for us something new,\\
open mind for a different view\\
and nothing else matters.

\chorus{}Never cared for what they do,\\
never cared for what they know\\
but I know.

\chorus{}Never cared for what they say,\\
never cared for games they play,\\
never cared for what they do,\\
never cared for what they know,\\
and I know.\\
