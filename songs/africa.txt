\verse{1}\A{}I hear the drums \Csm[7]{}echoin' to\Fsm{}night, but \A[/E]{}she hears only\\

She's coming in, twelve-thirty flight, moonlit wings\\
reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation.

I stopped an old man along the way, hoping to find\\ 
some old forgotten words or ancient melodies.

\A{}He turned to \Csm[7]{}me as if to \Fsm{}say:\\
\uv{Hurry boy, it's \G{}waiting there for you!} \Fsm{}\hskip 2.7em \Hm{}

\verse{2}The wild dogs cry out in the night, as they grow restless\\
longing for some solitary company.

I know that I must do what's right, sure as Kilimanjaro\\
rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

I seek to cure what's deep inside,\\
frightened of this thing that I've become.\\
