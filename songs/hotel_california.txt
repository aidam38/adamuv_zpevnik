\verse{1}
\Am{}On a dark desert highway,\E{} cool wind in my hair,\\
\G{}warm smell of colitas\D{} rising up through the air.\\
\F{}Up ahead in the distance,\C{} I saw a shimmering light\\
\Dm{}My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,\\
\E{}I had to stop for the night.

\verse{2}
There she stood in the doorway,\\
I heard the mission bell,\\
and I was thinking to myself:\\
\uv{This could be heaven or this could be hell.}\\
Then she lit up a candle\\
and she showed me the way.\\
There were voices down the corridor,\\
I thought I heard them say:

\chorus
\F{}Welcome to the Hotel Cali\C{}fornia,\\
such a \E{}lovely place, such a \Am{}lovely face.\\
\F{}Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\C{}fornia,\\
any \Dm{}time of year you can \E{}find it here.

\verse{3}
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got a Mercedes Benz,\\
she got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends.\\
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.\\
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.

\verse{4}
So I called up the captain: \uv{Please bring me my wine}\\
\uv{We haven't had that spirit here since 1969.}\\
And still those voices are calling from far away,\\
wake you up in the middle of the night,\\
just to hear them say:\\
\textbf{R:}

\verse{5}
Mirrors on the ceiling,\\
the pink champagne on ice, (and she said,)\\
\uv{We are all just prisoners here, of our own device.}\\
And in the master's chambers\\
They gathered for the feast,\\
They stab it with their steely knives,\\
but they just can't kill the beast. 

\verse{6}
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door,\\
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before.\\
\uv{Relax,} said the night man,\\
\uv{we are programed to receive.\\
You can check out any time you like,\\
but you can never leave.}

\chorus{}Welcome to the Hotel California,\\
such a lovely place, such a lovely face.\\
They livin' it up at the Hotel California,\\
what a nice surprise, bring your alibis.
